## Quesions

### 1. What are the functionsof closed circuit rotor windings?

In majority of the cases additional windings, known as damper winding, are included to produce damping effect. These windings are closed and their dissipative action produce damping to rotor oscillations.

### 2. Why should the synchronous reactance be so high (1.5 to 2.0 p.u.)?

The reactance is in reverse proportional to the reluctance. In the design of the generator, the reluctance is always low to optimize the generator in terms of material and size.

### 3. Why should X/R ratio of a generator be so high?

The reactance is very high, due to the reasons stated in Q2.

The register of the circuit is designed to be as low as possible, since the conductors are conducting thousands of amperes. In order to reduce the thermal loss, the resistance should be low, resulting in a high X/R ratio (typical value around 300).

### 4. Can the generator be operated at theoretical maximum power? Justify your answer

No. If the generator is operated at maximum power, i.e. $\delta =90\degree$, it is not stable. For example, if the mechanic torque increases, which will lead to the increase in $\delta$, the electrical power output is supposed to increase as well to keep the system stable. However, if it is operating at maximum output, the ouput power will decrease, which will lead to a further increase of $\delta$ and the lost of synchronization.
