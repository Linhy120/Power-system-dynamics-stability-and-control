## Quesions

### 1. Why does generator operate at synchronous speed?

Because the AC grid is operating at a fix frequency.

### 2. Why do we need voltage control?

Voltage control is essential to maintain the reactive power in the system within the controllable region. Maintaining the voltage within the limits is also necessary for the insulation of the devices.

### 3. Which of voltage and frequency control can be influenced by the network?

Voltage control. To control the frequency, it requires the injection of the active power, which is not possible by changing the network.

### 4. How does one characterise lightening strikes in transmission line?

The peak value (usually in kiloampere) and the duration (typical value 1.2/50 microseconds).

### 5. How does one characterise switching transient in transmission system?

By the magnitude of the over voltage and the duration. (Typical value for 400 kV system, 2 times the rated voltage and 200~2000 microseconds)

### 6. What types of power plant exhibit mechanical resonance in the sub synchronous frequency range?

All power plants that utilize multi-state/pressure-compounded turbines.

### 7. What type of stability study is important for assessing the fault behaviour of synchronous generator?

Trasient stability. Transient stability problem usually arises when the output power of the generator drops, while subsynchronous resonance usually comes from network side, especially which is series compensated.

### 8. What is of prime importance in small signal stability studies? 

Damping is a critical parameter in such studies.
